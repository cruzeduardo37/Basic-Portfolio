		<p>
			<strong class="boldH">H</strong>ola, my name is Eduardo. I am a 22 year old, trying to find himself in this world. I love poetry, music, fashion, and technology. Business and Entrepreneurship are what drive me and will be my career.
		</p>

		<p>
			My path hasn't always been the easiest, but that will make my success story better, everyone has a path. In the recent past I've become very motivated to do something with my life. One of my goals is to find a way an merge everything, or almost everything I love into one. I would love create a place where you can combine fashion with technology and real estate. Another goal of mine, is to create a scholarship fund in 2018. Right after I finish this coding boot camp and begin my new career, I'll begin with my scholarship fund.
